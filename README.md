## Packet Sniffer

# Description

This is a simple packet sniffer written in Python. It captures and analyzes network packets, displaying relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

# How to Use

1) Run the script in a Python environment. You may need to run it with sudo privileges if you are on a Unix-based system.
2) The script will start listening for packets on all network interfaces.
3) When a packet is captured, the script will print out the source and destination MAC addresses and the protocol.

# Code Structure

The code consists of a main function that sets up a socket and enters a loop, continuously listening for packets. When a packet is received, it is unpacked and analyzed, and the relevant information is printed out.

# Example

Here is an example of what the output might look like:
Ethernet Frame:
Destination: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF, Source: FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA, Protocol: 8

In this example, AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF is the destination MAC address, FF:EE:DD:CC:BB:AA is the source MAC address, and 8 is the protocol (indicating IPv4).

Note that this is a very basic packet sniffer and does not include any advanced features such as filtering or saving packets to a file. Itâ€™s intended as a starting point for learning about network programming in Python.

# Usage

Note that you may need to have certain permissions or privileges on your system to capture network packets. On Unix-based systems, you may need to run the script with sudo privileges.
